# Taskify - TypeScript Todo Application

A Todo List application built with React and TypeScript. This project was created as part of my learning journey to understand TypeScript with React, following modern best practices and implementing state management using React hooks.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with TypeScript in a React application
- Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Manage application state using React's useReducer hook
- Handle form submissions and user interactions
- Style components using CSS
- Write clean, maintainable code

## Features

- ✏️ Add new tasks
- 🗑️ Delete tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete
- 📝 Edit existing tasks
- 💾 State management with useReducer
- 🎨 Responsive design

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library
- **TypeScript**: Static typing
- **CSS**: Styling
- **React Icons**: Icon library
- **Git**: Version control

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained experience in:
- TypeScript fundamentals and type safety
- React Hooks (useState, useReducer, useRef)
- Component composition
- Form handling
- State management
- CSS styling

## Acknowledgments

This project was built following a tutorial by Roadside Coder on YouTube, with additional features and modifications added by me. It helped me understand TypeScript integration with React and modern state management practices.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements I plan to add:
- Local storage integration
- Drag and drop functionality
- Categories for tasks
- Due dates for tasks
- Search and filter functionality
